Census Income Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual earns more than $50000 per year using the UCI census income
datset. The goal in the project is to clean, preprocess and prepare the dataset for machine learning models. 

The dataset contains demographic educational and occupational features that are relevant when it comes to income prediction
Understanding these patterns will help provide insight into other socioeconomic factors. 


Dataset : UCI Machine Learning Repository - Census Income (Adult) dataset
Source : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income
Size : 48842 instances with 14 predictive features and 1 target variable. 
The features include a mix of both numeric and categorical features.
Numeric : age, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week
Categorical : workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country. 
Target Variable : Less than 50000 or More than 50000


To be completed : 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of demographic patterns.

Modeling using baseline (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) and advanced models (Random Forest)

Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of income.
